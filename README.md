### Introduction

**Software Architecture**: is
  * how the defining components of a system are **organized and assembled**.
  * how they communicate with each others.
  * and the constraints the whole system is roled by.

**Architectural Pattern**: is the overall structure of the system, define the **granularity** of the components.
  * **granularity**: is how big or small the component should be.
